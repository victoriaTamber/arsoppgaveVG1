    <h2>How i got to this point</h2>
    <div class="aboutmeT1">
        <p>I have always had an interest in technology from an early age, but I have never gotten the opportunity to
            gain experience because of my problems attending school and bullying.
            In eighth grade I joined a coding club at Årvoll middle school. I have worked with micro bit, scratch, and
            Lego robots. In this club we joined a robot competition named Robot Lego League, we were competing with
            other coding clubs around eastern Norway. I had some small jobs with the club, and we introduced and taught
            children’s diverse types of technology. The coding club motivated me to attend school again at that time.
            Now I am 16 years old, and I am a high school student at Kuben.</p>

    <h2>The reason i have chosen IM at Kuben</h2>
    <div class="aboutmeT2">
        <p>I have chosen to attend IM because it has two education programs in one. Information technology and media
            production, because it gives me more options to choose what I would do in the future. I am a person that
            want to learn new things, my biggest curiosity at the moment and in the past is to learn Java script and
            other programs, but I have never had the opportunity to do it. But now I am learning at IM and in addition
            to that, I am very curious to learn more about cameras, picture editing and editing video in media
            production. One thing I have learned about myself while going at IM is that I focus on the task, and I do
            not play around. </p>
    </div>

    <h2>What i have learned at IM</h2>
    <div class="aboutmeT3">
        <p> I have worked in Photoshop, Premiere Pro, Adobe Illustrator in Adobe Creative Cloud. In VSC (Visual Studio
            Code) I have learned HTML, CSS and a little bit Java Script.
            We have worked on network and webservers and we at IM have learned about complementary colours and how you
            can make a logo for websites. I have learned new things and I am excited to learn more.
            As a side project to this website, I am working on a website for MOKI. This is a project that is created by
            students that take the technology course and study at Kuben, and there I am making a website for their
            project that they are going to use. I have learned a lot at IM and i cant wait to learn more!</p>
